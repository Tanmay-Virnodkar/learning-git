SO this is the local change that we want to do and see what notification is given by git bash for the local as well as remote repo.
As you are suggesting I will add few lines to describe what i will do :-

Agenda:-
1) We want to see if there is any notification given by local git bash if we edit a file locally and this changes are missing from remote repo.
2) Can we request for review and merge for a forked branch and that branch to be added in the Owners Repo.
3) And again to check if we get any notification from local git bash after we add the local branch into owners repo.


Again adding few lines in the same file in a different branch.
